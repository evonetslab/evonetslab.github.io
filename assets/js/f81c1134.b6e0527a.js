For that, the student will compile all available data on host use for Nymphalinae butterflies, apply recent methods to predict interactions, and test these predictions by rearing caterpillars of various butterfly species on the predicted host plants. The project will result in a pipeline for faster collection of interaction data and the generation of valuable new data on tropical species.\\n\\nApplication deadline April 30 2025.\\n\\nMore info [here](https://www.slu.se/en/about-slu/work-at-slu/jobs-vacancies/?rmpage=job&rmjob=12583&rmlang=UK)."},{"id":"treeppl_postdoc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/treeppl_postdoc","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-26-treeppl-postdoc/index.md","title":"Postdoc/researcher position","description":"We are looking for a postdoc/researcher with documented experience with phylogenetic comparative methods and R-package development.","date":"2025-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"vacancies","permalink":"/blog/tags/vacancies","description":"New positions at Evonetslab"}],"readingTime":1.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mariana P Braga","title":"Associate Senior Lecturer","url":"https://github.com/maribraga","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/mariana"},"socials":{"googlescholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jhRKaPAAAAAJ&hl=en","github":"https://github.com/maribraga"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/maribraga.png","key":"mariana"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"treeppl_postdoc","title":"Postdoc/researcher position","authors":["mariana"],"tags":["vacancies"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"PhD student position","permalink":"/blog/spectro_phd"},"nextItem":{"title":"DDLS Fellowship","permalink":"/blog/ddls"}},"content":"We are looking for a postdoc/researcher with documented experience with phylogenetic comparative methods and R-package development.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe successful candidate will be working within the development team of [TreePPL](https://www.treeppl.org), a universal probabilistic programming language and new software for phylogenetics.
