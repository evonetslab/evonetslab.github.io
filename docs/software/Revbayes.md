## Host repertoire in RevBayes

<br/>

The **model of host repertoire evolution** [(Braga et al. 2020)](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/69/6/1149/5810100) was designed to infer ancestral ecological interactions. The original version of the model was implemented in RevBayes. Here's a **[tutorial](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/host_rep/host_rep)** for analysing your data.

<br/>

In this implementation you can:

- Estimate ancestral hosts for parasite clades
- Estimate parameter values such as rate of host gain and loss
- Test whether it is easier to gain phylogeneticaly close hosts than distant ones (or any other distance measurement)
