<br/>

*evolnets* has the necessary tools to reconstruct ancestral ecological networks based on posterior probabilities of interactions, as well as other types of reconstructions. Here's the **[documentation](https://maribraga.github.io/evolnets/)** for the package.

<br/>

With this R package you can:

- Plot estimated ancestral hosts for parasite clades
- Plot realised and fundamental ancestral host repertoires
- Plot ancestral and extant networks
- Calculate structural properties of ancestral and extant networks
