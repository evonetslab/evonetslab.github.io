## Host repertoire in TreePPL

<br/> 

The model of host repertoire evolution was designed to infer ancestral ecological interactions. The model was first implemented in [RevBayes](/docs/software/Revbayes.md) and now is also available in **[TreePPL](http://treeppl.org)**.

<br/>

In this implementation you can:

- Estimate ancestral hosts for parasite clades
- Estimate parameter values such as rate of host gain and loss
- Test whether it is easier to gain phylogeneticaly close hosts than distant ones (or any other distance measurement) 
- *Estimate extant (non-observed) hosts* **(coming soon)**
