We are looking for a PhD student interested in host specialization in tropical butterflies!

<!-- truncate -->

The aim of this PhD position is to develop a novel phylogenetic approach to predict unknown species interactions. For that, the student will compile all available data on host use for Nymphalinae butterflies, apply recent methods to predict interactions, and test these predictions by rearing caterpillars of various butterfly species on the predicted host plants. The project will result in a pipeline for faster collection of interaction data and the generation of valuable new data on tropical species.

Application deadline April 30 2025.
