We are looking for a postdoc/researcher with documented experience with phylogenetic comparative methods and R-package development.

The successful candidate will be working within the development team of [TreePPL](https://www.treeppl.org), a universal probabilistic programming language and new software for phylogenetics. The successful candidate will be responsible for the user-interface aspects of the project, through development of the R package [treepplr](https://www.github.com/treeppl/treepplr). The work will include development and implementation of methods to test model adequacy, inference diagnostics, model comparison, and visualization of outputs from various models, including host repertoire evolution, tree inference, and diversification.
